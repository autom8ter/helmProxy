## Command Line

```
helmgate -h
Usage of helmgate:
      --config string   path to config file (env: HELMGATE_JWKS_URI) (default "helmgate.yaml")
```

## Sample Config


```yaml
# port to serve on. metrics server is started on this port+1
port: 8820
# enable debug logs
debug: true
# rego policy for authorization. inputs: input.claims(map), input.headers(map), input.request(map), input.method(string)
# caution - this one allows any request
rego_policy: |-
  package helmgate.authz

  default allow = true
# query the allow variable
rego_query: "data.helmgate.authz.allow"
# remote json web keys uri for verifying inbound JWTs
jwks_uri: "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs"
# add list of helm repos to load at startup
repos:
  - name: "stable"
    url: "https://charts.helm.sh/stable"
```

## User Interface

Please take a look at the following options for stategate user-interface clients:

- [OAuth GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/autom8ter/oauth-graphql-playground): A graphQL IDE that may be used to connect & interact with the full functionality of the stategate graphQL API as an authenticated user

## Notes

- graphQL API is served on :8820/graphql by default
- gRPC API is served on :8820 by default
- metrics server(prometheus/pprof) is served on :8821 by default
- intended to be exposed publicly behind an SSL load balancer/ingress as an alternative to exposing your Kubernetes API
- jwks uri is used to fetch public keys from a remote source in order to verify inbound JWTs - this is authentication
    - if no jwks uri is provided, inbound jwt's will not be verified(insecure)
- a rego policy may be added to the helmgate config in order to implement fine-grainded authorization
    - if the rego policy is empty, a default allow-all policy will be used(insecure)
- input attributes passed to the rego authorization policy on each client request include: 
    - `input.claims(map)` - the payload/claims of the inbound jwt
    - `input.headers(map)`- the headers of the inbound request
    - `input.request(map)` - the payload of the inbound request
    - `input.method(string)` - the gRPC method of the inbound request
